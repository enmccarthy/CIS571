CFRA MAINTAINS HOLD OPINION ON UNITS OF FERRELLGAS PARTNERS(FGP5.29 ) : We lower our 12-month target by $1 to $5.50 on continued operating difficulties. We widen our FY 17 (Jul.) loss per unit estimate by $0.11 to $0.43 and keep FY 18's earnings per unit at $0.29. Our target is a peer-discount 8.5X EV/FY 18 EBITDA ratio that we think is merited by our view of depressed EPS levels. We see FGP addressing high leverage ratios by reducing debt levels. FGP posts Apr-Q EPS of $0.07, vs. $0.19, below our $0.18 estimate and the $0.10 S&P Capital IQ consensus. EPS was hurt by lower propane volumes due to warm winter weather and less favorable customer mix.

CFRA MAINTAINS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC.(VZ46.66 ) : VZ closes on its acquisition of Yahoo's core assets for $4.5B. Yahoo assets are being combined with AOL's legacy assets to form a new VZ unit called Oath. VZ expects to shed 2,100 jobs post deal, or 15% of Oath employees. We think Oath CEO Tim Armstrong's previous comments to increase total users to 2B by 2020 (1.3B currently) and generate sales of $10B-$20B (assumes 12% of VZ's revenue at mid-point) may prove to be too aggressive. Nonetheless, we like VZ's efforts to diversify its revenue base and see the potential to further expand on its digital advertising efforts.

CFRA MAINTAINS STRONG BUY RECOMMENDATION ON SHARES OF WPX ENERGY INC.(WPX10.36 ) : WPX agrees to a partnership with Howard Energy Partners to develop oil gathering and natural gas processing infrastructure in the Stateline area of the Permian's Delaware Basin. The JV will support WPX's drilling operations in the Stateline area (37% of WPX's Delaware acreage). The terms of the deal are: 50/50 joint venture; Howard will finish constructing the assets and serve as operator; and WPX receives $300 million upfront and $132 million in capital carry. We think this deal, expected to close in Q3, adds liquidity and opens up further midstream monetization opportunities.

CFRA INITIATES COVERAGE ON SHARES OF NORTHWESTERN WITH A HOLD OPINION(NWE61.90 ) : We initiate our 12-month target price at $62 and our '17 and '18 EPS estimates at $3.43 and $3.54 on this regulated electric & gas utility. Our target is a peer-discount 18.1X our '17 EPS estimate, which we think is warranted by our projection of a below-peer 3-year EPS growth rate. We see electric customer growth at more than twice and natural gas customer growth 50% higher than the national average. In our view, strong capital spending will likely also help drive future EPS growth. We see NWE raising its $2.10 dividend, yielding 3.4%, faster than EPS for the next few years.

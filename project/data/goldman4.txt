We are raising our 12-month target price by $10 to $255 applying a wider risk premium and a forward P/E multiple of 13.2X our 2017 earnings estimate, in line with peers. With a slightly more optimistic view than the consensus, our EPS estimates are unchanged at $19.30 in 2017 and $21.00 in 2018. GS has the largest revenue exposure to the capital markets vs. other global investment banks. Year-to-date investment banking fees in M&A and IPOs are positive drivers to the company's outlook, along with increased trading volumes in equities and fixed income. We would hold the shares.

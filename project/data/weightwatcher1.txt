We raise our 12-month target by $6 to $20, or 14.5X our '17 EPS estimate of $1.38 (up $0.23, including $0.15 tax benefit from the ending of Spain operations). The discount to WTW's 10-year forward P/E average (16X) reflects an adjustment to exclude the $0.15 tax benefit). We set '18's EPS projection of $1.30. Posts adjusted Q4 EPS of $0.18 vs. $0.03 loss per share, above our $0.14 estimate, despite a revenue miss. Recruiting trends, a precursor to revenues, continue to be positive. The number of meeting subscribers rose 9.7% at year-end, but we note high balance sheet leverage.

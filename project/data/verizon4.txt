We adjust our 12-month target price to $52 from $54, on near peers EV/EBITDA of 7X our '18 view. We cut our '17 EPS estimate to $3.80 from $3.89 and '18's to $3.90 from $4.00. VZ posts Q1 EPS of $0.95, vs. $1.06, missing the $0.96 consensus estimate. Sales fell 7.3% (down 4.5% ex. divestitures/acquisitions) and margins narrowed, hurt by wireless declines of 5.1%. Wireline fell 0.6%, as legacy declines were partly offset by acquisitions and healthy Fios growth. We positively view momentum for VZ's unlimited plan after mid-February launch, but note 289,000 postpaid phone losses.

The beat on the bottom line, and an outlook for stronger profit this quarter, is restoring confidence in the company's profitability generally.

While revenue estimates are going down today, profit estimates are going up and price targets are rising at some shops, with analysts saying the company is " back on track."

Tech Data is something of a bellwether for personal computers, and so management's comments that it was helped in the quarter by PC sales could be taken as good news for Intel ( INTC) and Microsoft ( MSFT). Those stocks are up slightly today.

Q3's revenue, for the three months ended in October, rose 41%, year over year, to $9.14 billion, including the " technology solutions" business that Tech Data bought from Avnet ( AVT) back in February. That was ever-so-slightly ahead of the average $9.1 billion consensus estimate. EPS of $2 beat on the bottom line by 9 cents.

For this quarter, the company sees revenue of $1.025 billion to $1.08 billion, which, at the mid-point, $1,052.5 billion, is below the average estimate for $10.58 billion, although the outlook for EPS, $3.35 to $3.65 is ahead of consensus for $3.39.

Among bullish notes today, Stifel's Matthew Sheerin reiterates a Buy rating, and a $110 price target, writing that the company is "back on track with good results," noting that management says that factors that held back in earnings in its Q2 "have largely been resolved."

Sheerin writes of the company's profitability that " overall gross margin was still within expectations, a sign that TECD is managing its broad product and customer portfolio for profitability and returns."

Sheerin trims his revenue estimate for this year to $36.21 billion from $36.3 billion, and trims next year's estimate to $36.9 billion from $36.11 billion. His EPS estimate for this year, however, goes up to $9.11 from $9.04, while for next year he sticks with an estimate for $10.60.

Needham & Co.'s Sean Hannan, reiterating a Buy rating, and raising his price target on the stock to $110 from $102, writes that the company is "putting some of the noise behind from its disappointing fiscal Q2 results," and calls the report "strong."

He thinks the outlook for this quarter is "somewhat conservative," as Q4 is usually a "seasonally strong" one for the company.

The Tech Solutions acquisition had the effect of boosting the company's gross profit margin by 0.89 of a percentage point, to 5.76%, he notes, while operating margin also increased a quarter of percentage point, to 1.49%. Writes Hannan, there's "more to come."

"Given that TECD is still completing its cost reduction efforts ($50 million in costs removed by end of fiscal 2018, another $50 million by end of fiscal 2019), we expect healthy margin expansion to continue for many quarters."

Hannan trims his numbers for revenue for this year and next, to $36.207 billion in revenue from $36.326 billion for this year, and to $37.58 billion from $37.736 billion for next year. But his EPS estimates are going up: he now sees EPS of $9.10 for this year, up from $8.92 previously, and EPS of $10.28 for next year, up from $10.18.

Shares of enterprise and cloud "hyper-converged" vendor Nutanix ( NTNX) are up $3.61, or 11%, at $36.41, staging an impressive rebound from some initial after-hours losses last night, after the company reported fiscal Q1 results that bested analysts' expectations, and forecast this quarter's results better on the bottom line.

The central point of the story today is the company's intention to be more and more just a software vendor, something consistent with the remarks that CEO Dheeraj Pandey has made in this blog in past. Last night Nutanix told analysts that hardware revenue, which was 26% of the company's "billings" last quarter, will decline to just 9% by the end of this fiscal year.

That's a distinct contrast to some competitors such as Pure Storage ( PSTG), whose chief executive, Charles Giancarlo, on Tuesday told me hardware excellence continues to be important to the company's use of flash-based storage.

In a phone call following the report and the conference call, Pandey told me that move to software is akin to the move Netflix ( NFLX) made a decade ago, "from shipping videos to streaming videos over the Web," as he put it.

"There's a much larger market as you move to more software," he said.

"Investors are slowly beginning to get it," he told me last night, "but they are waiting and watching to see that we execute on our promise, in the form of a software P&L."

Some appear to be getting it. Shebly Seyrafi of FBN Securities, reiterating an Outperform rating, and raising his price target to $40 from $30, writes the "gross margin percentage is going to materially increase over the coming quarters."

"For example, had NTNX not recognized any pass-through hardware over the past 12 months, its GM% would have been above 80% (vs. the 61-64% reported), so as pass-through hardware % of billings approaches 5%, we expect overall GM% to increase materially (please see our model)."

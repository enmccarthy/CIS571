Germany Removes Tesla From Subsidies List as Cheapest Car Too Expensive -Reuters

--Germany has removed Tesla from a list of car makers eligible for electric-vehicle subsidies, as its cheapest car sold in the country is above a 60,000-euro limit included to exempt premium models, Reuters reports.

--Tesla customers cannot order the base version of the Model S without extra features, pushing the car above the EUR60,000 threshold, a spokesman for the German Federal Office of Economics and Export Control said on Friday, Reuters says.

--However, Tesla said in a statement: "This is a completely false accusation. Anyone in Germany can order a Tesla Model S base version without the comfort package, and we have delivered such cars to customers."

--Germany last year launched the incentive scheme worth about EUR1 billion, partly financed by the German car industry, to boost electric car usage, according to Reuters.

Flash memory-based storage technology vendor Pure Storage ( PSTG) this afternoon reported fiscal Q3 revenue and profit that topped analysts' expectations, and forecast revenue higher this quarter as well, though its stock quickly gave up gains and went slightly lower in late trading.

CEO Charlie Giancarlo, who was named to the top spot in August, trumped the fact the company has "built a platform that allows customers to build a better world with data," and mentioned uses for artificial intelligence in particular.

CFO Tim Riitters called it "an excellent quarter," noting positive free cash flow "and a continued march toward profitability," said Pure Storage.

"We are excited to be fast approaching the $1 billion annual revenue mark and our first profitable quarter on a non-GAAP basis."

Revenue in the three months ended in October rose 41%, year over year, to $278, yielding a net loss of a penny per share.

The Street is, on average, modeling revenue of $272 million and a net loss of 3 cents per share, excluding some costs.

For the current quarter, the company sees revenue in a rage of $327 million to $335 million, which is better than consensus for $329 million.

Pure stock is down $1.13, or almost 6%, at $17.89.

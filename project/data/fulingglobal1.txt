Both Revenues and Sales Volume Hit Record High, Following Growth of 23.3% and 19.2%, Respectively

ALLENTOWN, PA., Nov. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Fuling Global Inc. (NASDAQ: FORK) ("Fuling Global" or the "Company"), a specialized producer and distributor of plastic serviceware, with precision manufacturing facilities in both the U.S. and China, today announced its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017.

Mr. Xinfu Hu, Chief Executive Officer of Fuling Global, commented, "We are very pleased to report strong results for the third quarter with both revenues and sale volume reached record high on the back of continuing demand momentum for our products. Total revenues increased by 23.3% to $34.4 million, thanks to a 19.2% increase sales volume as well as a moderate increase in blended average selling price ("ASP") of 3.5%. However, our margins and profitability decreased as the increase in cost of goods sold outpaced the increase in revenues due to increase in material costs which were not able to fully pass over to customers."

Ms. Guilan Jiang, Chairwoman of Fuling Global, added, "Despite uncertainty on market factors, particularly material costs and pricing environment for our products, we are optimistic in our near-term outlook as our order book remains strong and our manufacturing capacity keeps expanding with the recent launch of the new factory in China. We look forward to better day ahead as we continue our steady growth path."

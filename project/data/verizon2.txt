S&P CAPITAL IQ MAINTAINS BUY RECOMMENDATION ON SHARES OF ON SEMICONDUCTOR CORP. (ON14.14 ) : We lift our 12-month target price by $4 to $17, a peer-discount P/E of 11.9X our '18 estimate to reflect ON's leveraged balance sheet. We keep our '17 EPS view at $1.19 and start '18 at $1.43. ON posts Q4 EPS of $0.29, vs. $0.19, over the $0.23 Capital IQ consensus. Sales rose 33% from Q3, above expectations, aided by the contribution from Fairchild. We see potential for margin expansion and greater earnings leverage given anticipated cost synergies from Fairchild. We see soft near term consumer revenue, but expect ON to capitalize from rising content in automotive applications.

S&P CAPITAL IQ MAINTAINS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF NRG ENERGY(NRG16.66 ) : We lift our 12-month target price by $4 to $17, reflecting higher peer valuations. We lower our '17 EPS estimate by $0.22 to $1.76 and '17's by $0.33 to $0.31. Our target is a peer-premium 8.9X EV/2017 EBITDA that we think is warranted by potential portfolio actions to enhance shareholder value. NRG announced today that it reached an agreement with activist investors to replace two board members with two new ones chosen by the investors and form a business review committee. We think this could lead to asset sales and an improved balance sheet with further debt reductions.

S&P CAPITAL IQ MAINTAINS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC.(VZ48.98 ) : VZ announces unlimited data plans for $80 per month or $180 for a family of four, not including taxes and fees. These prices are higher than comparable offerings. While VZ has avoided unlimited plans, we believe share loss to value providers T-Mobile (TMUS 62 ***) and Sprint (S 9 ***) are pushing it to be more aggressive. We think VZ's competitive advantage remains its superior network, but note others have caught up in recent years. We see limited traction for the unlimited plans, but think they may help prompt current subscribers from looking elsewhere for those options.

S&P CAPITAL IQ MAINTAINS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF NCR CORP.(NCR45.54 ) : We raise our 12-month target by $9 to $45, 13.6X our '17 EPS estimate. This multiple is a premium to its ten-year forward average P/E of 12X, reflecting our improving sales and earnings growth outlooks on higher software sales. We raise our '17 EPS estimate by $0.03 to $3.30 and set '18's at $3.62. NCR reported Q4 operating EPS of $1.18 vs $0.92, $0.14 above the Capital IQ consensus, aided by stronger sales growth. Q4 sales increased 7%, driven by 11% growth in Hardware on a 140% increase in Self-Checkout sales. We see 2.1% sales growth in '17, impacted by currency headwinds.

US stocks rallied a day after the Thanksgiving holiday, buoyed by retailers as consumers shopped on Black Friday.
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both posted weekly gains for the first time in three weeks.
In a shortened session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.15% at 23,557.9 points.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to 2,602.4, while the Nasdaq added 0.3% to 6,889.1.
Macy's closed 2.1% higher. The department store operator's chief executive told CNBC the company was better off this year than last and was seeing very robust online demand.
Rival retailers Kohl's, Gap and J.C. Penney all made modest gains.
US retailers make up to 40% of their annual sales during the holiday season.
Analysts and retailers said crowds at stores around the country this year were strong.
"Retail spending and online shopping news is looking good, spurring hopes for strong retail sales," said Peter Cardillo of First Standard Financial.
US shoppers had spent more than $2.8bn online by Thanksgiving evening, a 17% jump over the same period last year, according to Adobe Analytics.
However, Target ended 2.8% lower, with analysts noting that it closed its stores for several hours overnight while rivals stayed open.
Meanwhile, US oil prices hit a two-year high as North American markets tightened on the partial closure of a key pipeline linking Canada and the US.

Tesla's revealed more details about its forthcoming “Semi” electric truck, including a starting price of US$150,000.

That sum will probably buy you a version of the vehicle with a range of 300 miles (480 km). Tesla founder Elon Musk did not mention that model at the Semi's launch, instead choosing to talk up the 500-mile (800km) model as capable of handling 80 per cent of round-trip truck journeys in the United States.

To get your hands on either model, you'll need a down payment of US$20,000, four times the $5,000 Musk mentioned at the launch. The $150,000 price is also flexible: Tesla describes it as an “expected base price”. The same YMMV* pricing applies to the $180,000 500-miler.

If you absolutely must have a Tesla Semi, there's also an option to pay $200,000, today, to become one of the luck 1,000 buyers who get a “Founder's Edition”. Just what you get for the extra $20,000, other than being one of the first 1,000 to get behind the wheel, has not been revealed.

The 300-and-500-mile-range Semis sell for $20,000 or more than a diesel truck, but Tesla has again emphasises total cost of ownership as the vehicles' selling point and claimed cost-per-mile on fuel alone will soon make its trucks value for money. The company's also said the reliability of an all-electric drive train will mean more hours on the road, again lowering cost of ownership.

Tesla's new information repeated past promises of shipping some time in 2019. If all goes well. The company's previously missed shipping dates, or delivered fewer vehicles than hoped once its deadlines passed.
